# GitHub Push Instructions

Since direct authentication failed, you'll need to follow these steps to push your code to GitHub:

## Option 1: Generate Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a descriptive name
4. Set the expiration as needed
5. Select the "repo" scope to enable pushing to repositories
6. Click "Generate token" and copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
7. Use the token as your password when pushing:

```bash
cd /Users/satvikbajpai/Downloads/sim_partnr
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SatvikBajpai/slaoptimization.git
git push -u origin main
# When prompted, use your GitHub username and paste the token as your password
```

## Option 2: Use SSH Authentication

1. Generate an SSH key if you don't have one:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

2. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
   ```bash
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste your key and click "Add SSH key"

4. Change your repository remote from HTTPS to SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SatvikBajpai/slaoptimization.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: GitHub CLI

1. Install GitHub CLI if you haven't already:
```bash
brew install gh
```

2. Login to GitHub:
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow the interactive prompts
```

3. Push using GitHub CLI:
```bash
cd /Users/satvikbajpai/Downloads/sim_partnr
gh repo create SatvikBajpai/slaoptimization --source=. --public --push
```

Choose the method that works best for you based on your preferences and security requirements.
